/**
 * The purpose of the module.exports = {}; statement is to export an empty object as a module.
 * This file acts as a stub or a placeholder for assets or modules that are not relevant or required
 * for the current context or scenario.
 *
 * In testing or development environments, it is common to encounter scenarios
 * where certain modules or assets are not needed or are replaced with mock implementations.
 * Instead of including the actual assets or modules, an empty object is exported to satisfy
 * any import statements or dependencies in the code.
 *
 * By exporting an empty object, the code that depends on the module can still import it
 * without causing any errors or issues. This approach allows for better modularity and flexibility
 * in managing dependencies, especially in situations where the specific asset or module
 * is not essential or unavailable in the current context.
